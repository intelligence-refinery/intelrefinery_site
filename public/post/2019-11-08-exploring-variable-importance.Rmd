While examining feature importance is most commonly thought of as something to do after building a machine learning model, it can and should also be done before performing any serious data analysis, as both a sanity check and a time saver.

Seeing which input features are the most predictive of the target feature can reveal potential problems with the dataset and/or the need to add more features to the dataset. Ultimately, narrowing down the entire feature space to a core set of variables that are the most predictive of the target variable is key to building successful data models.

Here you will find a collection of model-independent and dependent approaches for exploring the "informativeness" of variables in a dataset.

## Unsupervised model-agnostic approaches

### Factor analysis of mixed-type data 




### Hierarchical clustering of variables


## Supervised model-agnostic approaches

### Variable similarity


### Correlation-based


### Information theory


## Model-dependent approaches

### Random forest
